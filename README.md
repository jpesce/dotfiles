# dotfiles

Configuration files for a bunch of programs. Each program is organized in its
own directory. The project uses
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage installation. 

## Instalation
After cloning, just execute `./install` to put [everything in its right place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUnXxh5U25Y).
